The Spring to Life drop brings more reasons to explore both near and far! Warm winds have swept across biomes, bringing new mob variants, ambient sounds, and lush plants for you to discover.

In this release we are also making the game tests system accessible through data packs with the new test command.

## Minecraft Java Edition 1.21.4

Shh! I'm writing this changelog from behind a Pale Oak tree – and I have to be very quiet because the Garden Awakens drop is finally here – and Creakings are spawning in Pale Gardens all across the Overworld! The Garden Awakens brings with it an eerie biome – the Pale Garden – which is carpeted in moss, filled with Pale Oak trees, and home to a unique flower called an Eyeblossom. It also brings a watchful hostile mob, the Creaking, as well as the secret to defeating (and spawning) it – the Creaking Heart! Facing up to a Creaking will also earn you Resin Clumps – another new block you can craft into Resin Bricks, or use to trim your armor. Was that everything? Oh! And we've also made some bug fixes. Now, let me see if I can back away slowly without this Creaking spotting me…

### New Features

- Added Pale Garden Biome, Pale Oak tree, Pale Moss block, Pale Moss carpet, Pale Hanging Moss and Pale Oak woodset
- Added the Creaking mob, Creaking Spawn Egg and Creaking Heart block
- Added the Resin block family
- Added Eyeblossoms
